# MSMM
Midnight Suns Simple Mod Manager
Extract the MSMM.exe into its own folder wherever you want to keep it
Run setup folder on first run to create local 'mods' folder and to choose your Midnight Suns install directory
***NOTE***
Please select the root install directory
EX: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Marvel's Midnight Suns or I:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Marvel's Midnight Suns (some other steam library folder)
Do not select any other folder as the program works based off the root directory
Then simple use the tool to unzip mods into the games ~mods folder and delete the mods/pak files you no longer want to run
As of now it ignores folder structure inside the mod archives, this means mods with folders for multiple options are not currently supported naturally, instead simply unzip the archive and delete the .pak files you do not need in the right mods list
